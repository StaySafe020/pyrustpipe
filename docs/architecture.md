# PyRustPipe Architecture Design

## Overview
PyRustPipe is a high-performance library for processing semi-structured data (e.g., JSON, YAML) with validation and transformation pipelines. It combines Python's flexibility for defining rules with Rust's speed for execution, targeting ETL pipelines, real-time processing, and data science workflows.

## Core Components
PyRustPipe's architecture consists of the following components, visualized in the diagram below:
